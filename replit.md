# Alarm App - React Native with Mistral AI Integration

## Overview
A comprehensive mobile alarm app built with React Native and Expo that features unique dismissal codes generated using Mistral AI. The app requires users to manually enter a code to dismiss alarms, preventing easy snooze or accidental dismissal.

## Current State
- ✅ Fully functional React Native alarm application
- ✅ Expo development environment configured and running in Replit
- ✅ Web development server configured on port 5000
- ✅ Replit proxy compatibility configured (host verification bypass)
- ✅ Complete alarm management (create, list, toggle, delete)
- ✅ Secure dismissal system with manual code entry
- ✅ Proper notification scheduling and lifecycle management
- ✅ Copy/paste prevention and security measures implemented
- ✅ Local code generation (Mistral AI integration ready for backend)
- ✅ Production deployment configuration set up

## Recent Changes (September 21, 2025)
### Replit Environment Setup
- Successfully imported GitHub repository to Replit
- Configured Expo web development server for Replit proxy environment
- Set up proper workflow running on port 5000 with webview output
- Modified metro.config.js to handle CORS headers for proxy compatibility
- Updated package.json scripts to use proper host configuration for Replit
- Configured autoscale deployment for production web builds

## Previous Changes (September 20, 2025)
### Architecture Improvements
- Fixed notification scheduling to use proper calendar triggers for daily/weekly alarms
- Implemented complete alarm lifecycle management (create, toggle, delete properly handles notifications)
- Enhanced dismissal system with per-alarm code persistence and expiration
- Added Android notification channels for better alarm behavior
- Replaced deprecated expo-av with expo-audio for sound playback

### Security Enhancements
- Implemented copy/paste prevention in dismissal code input
- Added attempt tracking and limits (5 attempts max)
- Code expiration enforcement (10 minutes)
- Secure code generation with multiple entropy sources

### Code Quality
- Comprehensive error handling throughout the application
- Proper async/await usage and error boundaries
- Clean separation of concerns (Storage, Notifications, AI services)
- React Native best practices implemented

## Project Architecture

### Core Services
- **AlarmStorage**: AsyncStorage-based persistence with full CRUD operations
- **NotificationService**: Expo Notifications wrapper with proper scheduling
- **MistralService**: Code generation service (ready for backend integration)

### Screens
- **AlarmListScreen**: Main dashboard with alarm management
- **CreateAlarmScreen**: Alarm creation with time, frequency, duration settings
- **DismissAlarmScreen**: Secure alarm dismissal requiring manual code entry

### Key Features
- Time-based alarm scheduling (once, daily, weekly)
- Configurable alarm duration (1-60 minutes)
- Unique 8-character alphanumeric dismissal codes
- Background notifications with proper Android channels
- Vibration patterns and sound alerts
- Attempt tracking and security measures

## Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd alarm-app
npm install

# Start development server (Replit)
npm run web

# Or manually:
npx expo start --web --port 5000 --host lan
```

## Testing
- Web development available at localhost:5000
- Mobile testing via Expo Go app using QR code
- All core functionality operational in development mode

## Production Considerations

### Mistral AI Backend Integration
Currently uses local code generation. For production:
- Create backend API endpoint for secure Mistral AI calls
- Implement proper authentication and rate limiting
- Add API key management via environment variables
- Validate and sanitize AI-generated codes

### Mobile App Deployment
- Configure proper app signing and store preparation
- Set up push notification certificates
- Implement proper permission handling for all platforms
- Add app icons and splash screens

### Security Hardening
- Implement additional biometric authentication options
- Add code complexity validation
- Enhanced attempt monitoring and account lockouts
- Secure storage encryption for sensitive data

## User Preferences
- Clean, intuitive mobile interface design
- Focus on security and preventing easy alarm dismissal
- Comprehensive alarm management features
- Real-time code generation with expiration
